First plot of percipitation showed that there were some days with zero rain, also really zero rain with "none" of which cannot be plotted. So this was ignored from the data set.

Additional interpretation was done at the bottom of every chart, please see code for more information

Given the size of the data, each section takes awhile to run, so give your computer time to process as it is quite robust
